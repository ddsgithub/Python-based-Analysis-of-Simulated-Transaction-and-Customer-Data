# Python-based-Analysis-of-Simulated-Transaction-and-Customer-Data
Businesses that rely on transaction data, such as e-commerce or financial services companies, need to analyze customer behavior and transaction trends to optimize their customer funnel and improve key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer retention and revenue growth. "Business Insights from Transaction Data" is a Python project that provides a systematic and organized approach to working with complex data sets by creating and analyzing synthetic transaction and customer data. The project demonstrates the ability to create modular functions for data transformation and analysis, which can be customized and updated to meet the specific needs of a business. The visualizations and analysis generated from this project can support businesses in making data-driven decisions related to marketing, promotions, discounts, and inventory management. Additionally, for someone who wants to build realistic synthetic data for testing purposes, this project provides functions to create representative transaction and customer data sets that incorporate trends such as seasonality, enabling the testing of various data analysis functions.
